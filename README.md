# MICC Website

Website for the Mutual Investment Club of Cornel

## How to Run

This is just a simple website built using HTML, Sass and JS. You can run it just by pointing any web server to it.

## Libraries used

- TypeIt (JS animation library for the home screen typing effect)

## Tips for future maintainers

- Originally was built using PHP for simple templating (You will notice that the HTML has a lot of duplicated structure that can be moved into templates)
  - If you want easier content creation for people with less technical know-how, (i.e. updating member pictures or member descriptions), could probably port to Wordpress or use something like Jekyll
- Use some sort of Sass compiler (I used a VSCode extension)
- Keep styles compatible with both phone-sized screens and computer screens. Currently, the site is fully mobile responsive so try to keep it that way
