    <p class="about-description">
    The Mutual Investment Club of Cornell (MICC) 
    is the oldest and largest undergraduate investment club at Cornell 
    University, with over $70,000 in assets. We manage an internationally 
    diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. Our mission is 
    to bring asset management capabilities into the hands of students with the 
    goals of promoting education, performance, and industry exposure to 
    students of all levels and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p class="about-description">
    Every semester MICC runs a campus-wide education series that stretches from 
    the basics of investing to more intensive topics such as valuation, 
    technical analysis, and options. Topics are usually presented by executive 
    board members, but anyone can contribute to and participate in these 
    sessions.
    </p>
    <p class="about-description about-description-last">
    In addition to weekly general body and education series meetings, MICC 
    offers members networking opportunities with it’s extensive alumni base, 
    and often sponsors events with employers throughout the year. In the past, 
    we have hosted stock competitions, workshops, and exclusive networking 
    sessions. These events provide members with valuable experiences speaking 
    with and learning from professionals in the financial services industry.

      <div class="sector-description sector-description-1">
        <p>The
          <strong>consumer sector</strong> invests in companies that make or sell products for every-day consumer use. This includes
          both discretionary consumer goods, such as jewelry or watches, and non-discretionary consumer goods, such as food
          and clothing. The consumer sector is one of the oldest in MICC and has a proven record of successful investments
          that have generated significant returns for the club. Current holdings include Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) and Louis
          Vuitton Moet & Hennessy (OTCMKTS: LVMUY).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sector-description sector-description-2">
        <p>The
          <strong>energy and commodities sector</strong> seeks to invest in companies that produce, maintain, or distribute energy
          or commodities products around the world. The sector looks to generate market-leading returns by targeting investments
          in companies that outperform energy indexes through use of innovative technologies or unique strategic positioning.
          Past and current investments may include upstream, midstream, or downstream energy firms, and include companies
          such as Golar LNG Partners (NASDAQ: GMLP) and Summit Midstream Limited Partners (NYSE: SMLP).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sector-description sector-description-3">
        <p>One of the most popular teams for MICC members, the
          <strong>healthcare sector
          </strong> invests in companies involved in any or all areas of the healthcare market. These can include startup
          biopharmaceutical firms developing new drugs for market or large conglomerate firms involved in distribution, marketing
          and sales of established healthcare products. The sector strives to teach its members the unique modeling skills
          necessary for investing in healthcare, and it has a track record of placing alumni in jobs in the industry. Past
          and current holdings include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sector-description sector-description-4">
        <p>As the place for MICC’s
          <strong>technology, media, and telecommunications sector</strong> has recently expanded in size and popularity. The sector’s
          investment scope includes firms involved in manufacturing or selling technology products, as well as firms engaged
          in the media, entertainment, or telecom industries. The sector offers its members exposure to a wide variety of
          companies, as well as training in unique modeling skills necessary for certain types of TMT firms. Holdings have
          included The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and HubSpot Inc. (NYSE: HUBS).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sector-description sector-description-5">
        <p>Although only recently formed within MICC, the
          <strong>industrials sector
          </strong> is an important sector within MICC. The industrials team pitches firms involved in large-scale manufacturing
          and production of complex goods, such as automobiles or defense weaponry. Members in the sector gain exposure to
          firms that form the cornerstone of the world economy, giving them valuable experience in fundamental and technical
          financial analysis. The industrials sector currently holds investments in the Guggenheim Global Shipping ETF (NASDAQ:
          SEA)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sector-description sector-description-6">
        <p>With the help of three senior members, MICC's
          <strong>real estate sector</strong> was established in the Spring 2017 semester. Students on the real estate team analyze
          firms, funds, and investment groups, such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), that hold and/or manage physical
          properties. Members of the sector learn advanced real estate modeling techniques, such as Net Asset Valuation,
          and gain access to the number of MICC alumni who work in real estate finance. The real estate sector looks forward
          to growing in the coming semesters.
