    While the best way to learn about what we do is at one of 
    our <strong>information sessions</strong>, you can also get a
    pretty good understanding by reading more on our different 
    teams! This semester, we will be dividing ourselves into 
    <strong>6 sectors</strong>, each with their own interesting 
    projects, goals, and an incredibly commited team of 
    returning members!
